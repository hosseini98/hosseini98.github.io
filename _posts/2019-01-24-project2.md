# Project 3


## Introduction 
In early stages of a data project, espacially in early stages of a project, it is crucual to create visualizations to get an insight to your data. Matploylib and seaborn are two popular Python library that make visualizatio  much more easier. you can put all Visualization techniques in four different catagories:
 1. Comparison: Either You want to compare features with each other or a single featuer with itself at diffrent time points, the most popular techniques is to use bar chart. 
 2. Relationship: This is when you want to see how features in your data set are changing with respect to each other. Scatter plot and line plot are in this catagory. 
 3. Composition: Pie chart should be the one to refer when you want to understand the composition in a feature. 
 4. Distribution: Histograms (eighrt bar type or line type)  and scatter plot are usually used to understand the statistical characteristics of a feature.

 Here I will use this visualization techniques to get a meaning from this dataset and answer the following questions and provide evidence for our hypothesis:
